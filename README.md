# bookingSystem
P7-project containing a booking system built with Flask, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

To get a virtualenv running in your terminal that uses the same settings as this system type "pip install -r requirements.txt".

The CSS library we use is from Bootstrap, and the components we utilise are found at https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/components.

We are inspired by the work done in the CS50 Web track 2019 found at https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/tracks/web/.
